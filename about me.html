<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Sai always had a desire for knowledge. When he was a child, he consistently read advanced nonfiction books while others in his class were reading crime books. This love of literature led to an early career in writing. At 15 years old, Sai began reviewing novels for $5 per book review. This provided him with extra income, and he quickly developed a clientele. Since then, Sai has expanded into writing eBooks and novels. He has won several awards for both his fiction and nonfiction books.</p>

<p>In his spare time, Sai invests in the stock market. He likes to research various trading options, along with potential company upgrades. While trading allows Sai to earn additional income, it's also a hobby. When he earns extraordinary profits, James donates 50% of those profits to various charities and organizations in his city.</p>
